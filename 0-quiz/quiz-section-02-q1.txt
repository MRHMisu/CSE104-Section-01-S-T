Recently many automated grammar checker tools have been 
developed for assisting writers to locate grammatical 
errors in their writing.

Suppose you are going to develop a simple feature that 
will put an article (a/an) before any word which starts 
with a vowel.  Now write a program that takes the first 
character of a word as input and shows the output that 
it requires an article.


1) Sample Input: 'a'
Sample Output: Requires Article 'An'.

2) Sample Input: 'j'
Sample Output: Requires Article 'A'.

3) Sample Input: 'E'
Sample Output: Requires Article 'An'.
