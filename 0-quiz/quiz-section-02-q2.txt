Suppose you got a magic wallet that makes the money double each day. 
You have 10 Taka on Saturday and it will become 640 Taka next Friday 
(after 6 days).

For example: 
    Saturday=10;
    Sunday=10*2=20
    Monday=20*2=40
    Tuesday=40*2=80
    Wednesday=80*2=160
    Thursday=160*2=320
    Friday=320*2=640

Now write a program that takes two inputs, first the money 
you put into the wallet on the first day, and the number of days 
you want to keep that money into this wallet. 

The output will show the total amount of money the wallet will contain at the end of the given day.

1) Sample Input: 10 6
Sample Output: 640

2) Sample Input: 345 5
Sample Output: 11040
