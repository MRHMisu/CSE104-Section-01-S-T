In computing, digital images are represented as a matrix of bits in pixel format. 
To compare images their corresponding bit matrixes are used to determine whether 
the images are identical or different. Your task is given two-bit matrix of two images, 
identify whether those images are identical or different.


Input: two (3x3) Matrix

Output: Identical or Different

Sample Input:
