In standard writing test like in IELTS or TOFFEL, it is a common practice to write 
a response to a task within a word limit. For instance, 
write an essay on C programming within 250 words minimum.  
Therefore, it requires identifying the number of words in a given text 
to assess the written text. So, your task is to write a program that 
takes a text as input and compute the number of words written in the text.
